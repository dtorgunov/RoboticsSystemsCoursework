# Robotics Systems Coursework
Coursework source code for ENG3084M (Robotics Systems), submitted during academic year 2014-15.

The problem under consideration is finding a series of coordinates, relative to the world coordinate system, given the current values of angles for a series of revolute joints, using the Denavit-Hartenburg algorithm.

The kinematic parameters of the robot have been given as part of the specification.

This solution is written in the Haskell programming language.
